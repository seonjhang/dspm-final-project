## Introduction
VSP Vision owns Visionworks, a leading provider of eye care services in the United States that
operates at the intersection of healthcare and retail. Backed by a network of optometrists,
technicians, and retail associates, Visionworks offers comprehensive eye exams and a wide
selection of eyewear products, including glasses, sunglasses, and contact lenses. Customers
can shop in-store and online, with in-store displays organized by frame shape, price, and
gender, alongside dedicated brand marketing for labels like Nike and Calvin Klein.
The primary objective of this project is to analyze VSP Vision's eyewear product data to
determine the optimal frame assortment that will generate the highest sales across store
locations. Specifically, we aim to:
1. Identify the most popular frame styles, materials, and attributes
2. Determine the optimal price point ranges for different customer segments
3. Analyze demographic and geographic patterns in customer preferences
4. Evaluate how frame attributes correlate with sales performance
5. Develop data-driven recommendations for inventory optimization and assortment
planning
6. Identify opportunities to enhance customer satisfaction based on sentiment analysis

Through this analysis, we seek to provide VSP Vision's brand managers with actionable insights
to create targeted, location-specific frame assortments that align with customer preferences,
maximize sales, and enhance the overall customer experience.

## Dataset

description, which can be used for product sales predictions. The file consists of rows and
columns of text providing additional details in product style descriptions with designated
locations across the country.

To enhance our understanding of customer satisfaction and service quality, we supplemented
the quantitative frame data with qualitative consumer reviews collected from:
- Consumer Affairs website (606 reviews from 2010-2025)
