In September 2024, I purchased my present pair. The lens was chipped, so I went back to the office in Bowling Green, Ky, where I had purchased the last three pair. My lens was replaced free of charge. I was in Sam's Club and got hit in the face on the bridge of my nose with a package of toilet issue, causing the frame to get bent and the right lens to chip. When I went to have the lens and frames replaced, I was informed I would owe $193 to replace the frame and lens because I had used the warranty once. I was never informed there was restrictions on the warranty. I contacted corporate, but still no response. I will never go back to Visionworks.\n",

She gets angrily defensive and offensive when disagreeing about the quality of the glasses, and then she will continue making hostile angry comments for wanting to return the products. She is very belligerent, and I have witnessed making fun of people, while persuading other customers to join her humiliating other customers she does not like. She seems to have hate issues towards some people she does not like. I do not recommend this store. Customer service is not priority there.

After 3 hrs of testing and spending a lot of $ I was told that I do not have glaucoma and as far as the cataracts go to have the eye dr tweak my prescription and to continue to wear my glasses and to come back to Raleigh Optho for recheck in a year.

My husband opened the case, saw some oil stain on the lens so took out the cloth to mop the lens. While this Anthony was still crossing his arms and not saying or doing anything, my husband tried the glasses on and then shared his concern about the loose of the frame. Anthony then opened his mouth, told my husband (in his 60's) to shake, nod, shake, nod, shake, nod his heads couple of times, then said the frame could not be fixed and we should take the glasses to Shoprite for repair.

As soon as you step in the door they hit you with their mask policy which they say is for their customers' health and safety but when I inform them that I have a medical condition that prevents me from covering my airways my health and safety goes right out the door and doesn’t matter. If you are going to have a policy make sure it holds up against the science you think it’s built on. Their lenses are sub par as well. I was there less than 2 years needing more because the product doesn’t hold up. Don’t respond saying how you're sorry and call us and \"We will try to help.\" You had your chance and you blew it!\n",

We discussed that I wanted high def progressives with other options (no glare, scratch resistant, UV protection, Transitions). Associate said they only recommend Transitions Signature or XTRActive. After a quote of $210, he did a great job of helping me pick out attractive frames that would require no copay. We proceeded to filling out paperwork and taking measurements, etc. for ordering.\n",

The attended looked on the wall and matched the frames exactly by serial number. Next the charge. $58 which I had to pay up front. She told me she would pop lens out of the old into the new. Well of course that could not be done. I ask her if she could send back to the lab to fix. “No you would have to start the process again and buy a new pair.” So I had to get a refund for the money charged.

We went yesterday afternoon to this place to buy a pair of glasses to my son (he also wears contacts for the same place). His appointment with the doctor was scheduled at 6:30pm. One hour later, still there, still waiting for the doctor. I dared to ask the store manager what's happening and his rude response was, \"I don't know, this is a separate doctor's business, better no ask.\" Can you imagine? The doctor in the same store and it is not his business. Amazing. Then went to ask the doctor what's going on and ask for an estimate for how long do we have to wait (with two kids at 7:30pm, no dinner etc).\n",

The dr. told him that he needed glasses with bifocals; so he went to look at glasses and picked out 2 pairs (a clear pair and sunglasses). The dr. told me that I had an astigmatism which I never had a day in my life. After taking my current prescription contacts out and not being able to see the doctor told me that the glasses would be half off if I was to order the contacts and a pair of glasses the same day and was sent to look at glasses. I was able to pick out a nice pair with my boyfriend's help. I told the dr. what type of contacts I wanted and she ordered something totally different. \n",

I get my prescription from my eye doctor after a full one-hour exam. Very thorough. I also have diabetes. The first visit the clerk acted so patient. She recommended glasses different from my tastes over the past ten years. I'm used to titanium and rimless frames. She highly recommended a pair of circle metal frames for my small face. Cost was nearly $800 but with 40% discount I paid $507. When I arrived a week later to get them, this same clerk was rude. She barked orders for me to \"sit down\" and \"read this\" pointing to their suggestions on buying their lens cleaner and how to care for the lenses. She did not want to adjust the frames. She said they didn't need adjusting. When I returned home the glasses didn't fit in the case.\n",

I am positive that I paid for it, so is this human error, computer error, or a lie to get out of having to replace my glasses? Then they say that it wouldn't have mattered anyway because the insurance doesn't cover hinge breaks. What?

Now it's been just over 18 months and the lenses are so fuzzy that they are unusable. The first person I talked to at the store said it was because I rinsed them with water which breaks down the coating. I complained to their corporate customer service about the coating being biodegradable and was eventually routed to the store manager. She briefly looked at the lenses and said that the coating was fine but that the lenses are all scratched up. She said they couldn't be fixed and offered a 25% discount on new lenses. With that discount the price was the same as other nearby stores every day un-discounted price. \n",

I have gotten glasses there before, and with the former staff, I would have given them maybe a 2 star rating. With the current staff, this one is a 1, at best. After numerous trips over there, and having to have my sunglasses made twice and my regular glasses made 3 times, I still cannot see well with either of them. It seemed that the staff would not take seriously the fact that I have a difficult prescription, and great care must be taken in all phases of \"production\". The entire staff seemed wholly incompetent. I still have to crane my neck to see with my sunglasses, or else wear them on the end of my nose to be able to see to drive. The PD is (still) off on my regular glasses, and this distorts my vision and makes my eyes hurt. However, having grown weary of the many trips to that store, I have given up. I will live with these until next year, then I will go somewhere else. I will never to Visionworks, ever again!\n",

      "Text: I went in the first week of December, and was told my insurance would not pay for glasses that I broke as I had gotten another pair in Oct. I asked would it be covered in January and was told yes. I went in Jan. 3rd, and was told no my insurance would not pay for another pair until October of 2014, they were on a fiscal year, not a calendar year. So I then said, well, I will take the new frames then as I needed the glasses for reading. I was informed they did not have any at that location but there were 5 pairs in other stores. I said fine, the next day I was called and said they had phoned and they should be on the way. I did not hear anything so I went in on the 11th, and was told they were in, and when they went to get the frames, I was told they were the same as the glasses I got in October. So now I spend 45 minutes there while the clerk calls all over the country, thinks she has one, and will call my doctor to get my RX the next day, and put them in the frames, however, she said I could get a new pair much quicker if I bought news ones, and I was worried about ever getting the right frames so I said go ahead and set me up for new glasses. She figured the bill at $108 plus change, and I said go for it.\n",

That should have caused me to walk but we didn't. We bought the scratch warranty because my work is hard on lenses. When I went back 10 months later to have the lenses replaced they told me there was a $30 co pay. This was not covered during the initial purchase. I also pointed out that the finish was coming off the ear pieces and they needed to be replaced and was told that would be done when the lenses came in. When I went back to pick up the lenses and ear pieces I was told the frame warranty also had a $20 deductible at which time I told them that should have been brought up previously and the sales person insisted she had, not true. Then she accused me of lying when her manager came to see what was happening. The manager did not back down and both accused me of trying to get over on them.

If we fail to make these goals, we are written up. If we are written up multiple times for the same infraction, we are fired. I understand the complaints about the two pairs of $89 or $99. We are told by our general managers (and corporate) that we are to limit the amount of $69 frames out on the floor. This is so the company can squeeze more money out of the unsuspecting customers. There is a room in the store that holds bins full of $69 frames, yet we are not allowed to display them all because the company won't make their money. \n",

      "Review:  i had my eye exam last night 2-13-15, was told i was getting hd lenses and that the buy one get one was a better deal then my insurance. i ordered the glasses then today i read the reviews realized i had been taken so i canceled the order today. i will need to go in monday to turn in my \"free\" cleaning kit that i was charged for! buyer beware, in this case you aren't pay for what you get except a cheaper version that isn't what it is supposed to be. \n",

      "Review:  i had a appointment at 2:45 today. i arrived early. when i approached the desk the lady told me to give her my insurance info and be quick about it!! when i asked her to look it up she wouldn't even bother, was extremely rude and unprofessional. the dr sat right next to her during this and they acted like it was a big joke. how is this business still open?? \n",

      "Review:  i waited 2 weeks for glasses that had a prescription. i could have gotten over the counter. i could not see up close or at a distance. i was asked to take the glasses home and hope the focus became better. clearly, if i couldn't see with them while i was there in the store, i wouldn't be able to see driving. also, they would not accept my optimum financial card that clearly had enough available funds to cover the exam cost through my insurance. although my insurance covered the cost of the frames, minus the deductible, i was still out of pocket for inadequate service. for more details, i can be reached at **. \n",
      "\n",
      "Review:  very unprofessional and rude staff. don't know what they are doing. i ordered contact lenses for three of my kids. did not call me when they received the lenses. they handed me out the boxes without any name on it so we could not figure out whose lenses is whose. refused to hand over the contact lenses of my third kid saying that, \"we cannot give you contact lenses until you see the doctor\" (which i already paid for) instead of handing me over and advising that i bring it when i have doctor's appointment. during the same visit, i asked for a eye exam for myself and i was told i am not eligible, a complete mishandling and inability to do the job. wonder if doctors are also same. will never take my family there anymore and will advise the same in social media where i can. \n",
      "\n",
      "Review:  with insurance i spent over $400 at visionworks at cottonwood. i purchased transitional lenses that work well in the winter, but do nothing in the summer when you really need it. either the prescription was off or they didn't make the lenses correctly, but they were off. i have had many pairs of glasses over the 40 years i have been wearing them and have never broken a pair. this pair however fell apart just as the warranty ran out. they made it clear i would need to purchase another pair.... i made it clear it will never be from them. \n",
